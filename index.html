		<h1>Home of the Bond Programming Language.</h1>
		<p>Bond is a lightweight embeddable scripting language implemented in C++ and its source code is distributed for free under the permissive MIT license. Bond is very similar to C in many respects including syntax, static typing and explicit dynamic memory management.</p>
		<p>This website is still under construction, so please stay tuned for additional documentation. In the meantime, the source code for the Bond runtime library and command line toolset can be found on GitHub at the folllowing link: <a href="https://github.com/bondscripting/bond">https://github.com/bondscripting/bond</a></p>
		<p>Or download the source code from the command line with the following command:</p>
		<div class="code">
			<p>git clone https://github.com/bondscripting/bond.git</p>
		</div>
		<p>PS. Don't forget to read the README.txt file.
